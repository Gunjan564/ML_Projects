# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository is a collection of **machine learning projects**, each focusing on different techniques and real-world applications. The goal is to explore various **ML algorithms, data processing methods, and deployment strategies** to gain hands-on experience and build practical solutions.

## Projects in This Repository

### 1. Movie Recommender System (Content-Based Filtering)

- A **learning project** referenced from the **CampusX YouTube channel**.
- Recommends movies based on movie features such as genre, actors, and director.
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity** to generate recommendations.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used in this project is from **Kaggle**.
- Project files are structured as follows:
  ```
  Movie Recommender/
  │── Dataset/               # Contains dataset files
  │── MovieRecommender.py                 # Main application script
  │── download_files.py      # Script for downloading necessary pkl files
  │── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
  ```

### 2. *(More projects to be added, such as classification, regression, computer vision, NLP, etc.)*

## Features

- Multiple machine learning techniques implemented
- Interactive UI for user-friendly experience (if applicable)
- Scalable and efficient algorithms

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable), Streamlit (if deploying UI)
- **Datasets**: Kaggle, MovieLens, TMDB, or other relevant datasets

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gunjan564/ML_Projects.git
   cd ML_Projects
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Movie Recommender"
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python MovieRecommender.py
   ```
2. If using Streamlit for UI:
   ```bash
   streamlit run MovieRecommender.py
   ```
3. Interact with the project and analyze results!

## Datasets

- Each project will use appropriate datasets, such as **Kaggle** for movies or **Kaggle/UCI datasets** for other applications.
- Datasets should be placed in the respective `Dataset/` directory inside each project folder.

## Future Projects and Improvements

- Implement **classification models** (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
- Develop **regression models** (e.g., house price prediction, stock forecasting).
- Work on **computer vision applications** (e.g., object detection, image classification).
- Explore **NLP projects** (e.g., text summarization, chatbot development).
- Enhance UI/UX for better interaction.
